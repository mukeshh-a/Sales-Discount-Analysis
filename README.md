# Sales-Discount-Analysis

This project investigates the sales and discount policies of a superstore and provides recommendations based on the findings. 
The goal of this project is to help the store understand whether their discount policy is being misused and to identify areas where they can improve their profitability.

Data Collection & Table Structures:

The necessary data was collected and structured in MS Excel files. The following steps were taken to clean the data:

The 'Text to Column' feature was used to separate congested data into different cells.
Duplicate values were removed using the 'Remove Duplicate' feature.
The data was converted into a table using the 'Insert Table' feature.
Blank data was removed by selecting it using the 'Filter' feature.
The data type of 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' columns was changed to 'Short date.'
The data type of 'Sales', 'Discount', and 'Profit' was changed from General to Currency.

Dashboard

A dashboard was created to visualize the data and provide insights. 
The dashboard is available at [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mukesh.ale/viz/SuperstoresDashboard_16830373705840/Dashboard2].

Key Findings

The key findings of the analysis are:

Sales Analysis: Most Below Benchmark Sales are in the South Area.
Analysis by region: Central Region needs to be watched because it is losing more money.
Discount Analysis: Whenever the organization offers discounts more than 20%, it suffers more losses.
Product Analysis: Furniture is the most loss-making category.

Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are suggested:

Don't provide discounts that are greater than 20%.
Modify the discounting policy to guarantee that no item's weighted value exceeds 20% of total sales.
Keep an eye out for Central Region customers especially Houston misusing the discount policy.
Focus on significant loss-making products (Office supplies and Furniture).
By implementing these recommendations, the superstore can improve its profitability and ensure that its discount policy is being used effectively.
